# GAN Spike Count Generator

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating synthetic spike count patterns using TensorFlow and Keras.

**Features:**
- Generator transforms noise into realistic spike count patterns.
- Discriminator distinguishes real from generated spike count images.
- Loss calculated using Binary Crossentropy.
- Data augmentation enhances training diversity.

## Usage
1. Set up the environment with TensorFlow and dependencies.
2. Prepare spike count dataset and customize parameters.
3. Execute the training script.
4. Visualize generated spike count images and monitor progress.

## Sample Data
Includes scripts for loading and preprocessing sample spike count data.
